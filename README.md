# Torque Triumph
## By Ben Bancroft (bnb2@aber.ac.uk)

Torque Triumph is a racing game with the usual objective of being the fastest around the track.
You can choose from 1 of 9 vehicles for your attempt to beat either the AI or a friend on split screen multiplayer.
The game features a fairly accurate physic and collision system, so be careful that you stay on the track, and don't spin out when you collide.

All work was done by Ben Bancroft (bnb2@aber.ac.uk) unless otherwise stated on the about page, or in a comment in the code.
